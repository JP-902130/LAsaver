What is LAsolver:
This is the calculator that is used to solve most of the linear algebra arithmetics in first-year university. 

How to use the app:
The steps are simple. What you need to do is to choose the type of calculation you want to operate. NOTICE, you MUST read the given instructions in give input in the correct format to get the correct answer.

Input Standards:
Notice that the input format is important for the program for the evaluation. If you want to input a matrix. Please input all entries separated by space. At the end of each row, please change the line using enter. For the complex number, just input as you normally would, in the form of x +- bi where x and b are real numbers.


What skills we used:
Most of the program is built with OOP and modular programming. For each category of the operation (vectors, matrix, and complex), we create its module (file). In the module, we built a class, and functions that can do operations to this particular class. Then, in the main function, we import the modules we have built and integrate them with a simple main function. We also imported and learned a few python libraries (including math, os, sympy, numpy)

Inspirations about this project:
This project is inspired by the linear algebra course at UW. Both of us took this course in 1A and we found it challenging. Particularly, when we are doing practice, we found that it is hard to check solutions. Then we came up with the idea of building such an APP to help future students to learn and practice linear algebra better. 

Reflection about this project:
This is the first project we build in our university career. We were proud of our project because this project is built completely on our own, without the help of anyone. We use the theoretical concepts we learned in school and put it into actual use. Moreover, we learned how to use git/GitHub while we built projects with REPL in high school. In addition to technical skills, we enhanced our communication and the ability to resolve conflicts by encountering different adversities.
